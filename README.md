Here keeps what a Python beginner writes. Looks shitty? Yes it is.

## Projects

### [sb-remake.py](https://github.com/WiIIiamWei/my-shit-python-code/blob/main/sb-remake.py)
A remade version of sb.cpp in Python. Also my first code ever. Very shitty.

### [stream.py](https://github.com/WiIIiamWei/my-shit-python-code/blob/main/stream.py)
Something I wrote for fun. Just a regular bot that can help you stream in osu! (not really). Very powerful and I liked it. I pretty want to make a fully-functional version and that would be helpful.

### [match.py](https://github.com/WiIIiamWei/my-shit-python-code/blob/main/match.py)
Originally from my school's IT class. A calculator tool for calculating how many matchsticks need to be used to make the input number. The solution textbook used sucks, so I made my own.

### [strreverse.py](https://github.com/WiIIiamWei/my-shit-python-code/blob/main/strreverse.py)
Also a script I wrote for pasttime. A simple tool for reversing a given string, just as the name says. I did this on an online python3 complier, so I dun't know whether the script has bugs or not. Anyway it's supposed to be shitty since _"my-shit-python-code"_.
