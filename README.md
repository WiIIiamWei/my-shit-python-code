# my-shit-python-code
Here keeps what a Python beginner writes. Looks shitty? Yes it is.

## Projects

### sb-remake.py
A remade version of sb.cpp in Python. Also my first code ever. Very shitty.

### stream.py
Something I wrote for fun. Just a regular bot that can help you stream in osu! (not really). Very powerful and I liked it. I pretty want to make a fully-functional version and that would be helpful.
